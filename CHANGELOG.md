# Changelog

Notable changes to Aura Weather. The audit pass below captures the
work that hardened the dashboard from a polished demo into a
portfolio-grade product. Format roughly follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased] — Production polish pass (2026-05)

### Added

- **No-JS fallback.** `index.html` now renders a short, styled
  `<noscript>` notice explaining the dashboard needs JavaScript,
  instead of leaving a blank `<div id="root">`.
- **Edge headers and SPA fallback.** `public/_headers` ships the
  non-breaking security set (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
  `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `Referrer-Policy`,
  `Permissions-Policy` scoped to geolocation) plus a caching policy —
  immutable for content-hashed `/assets/*`, forced revalidation for
  `sw.js` and `manifest.webmanifest` so a deploy is never pinned by a
  stale cache. `public/_redirects` adds the SPA fallback so deep links
  resolve to the app shell. `public/robots.txt` gives crawlers an
  explicit policy.
- **PWA manifest hardening.** `manifest.webmanifest` gained `id`,
  `lang`, and `dir` for a stable installed-app identity and correct
  localisation hints.
- **Project metadata + LICENSE.** `package.json` now declares
  `description`, `keywords`, `homepage`, `repository`, `bugs`,
  `license`, and `engines.node` (>=20); a `.nvmrc` pins Node 20; and
  the repo ships an MIT `LICENSE`.
- **`useDocumentTitle` hook.** Mirrors the active forecast location
  into `<title>` (`Tokyo, Japan · Aura Weather`) once a location is
  known, and restores the static index.html title on unmount so cold
  starts still look branded. Five render tests pin the contract:
  preserves the static title until a name is known, includes the
  country when present, restores on unmount, and ignores non-string
  fields without crashing.
- **Screen-reader location landmark.** The first dashboard heading
  now appends an sr-only `in {location}` suffix (`Current Conditions
  in Tokyo, Japan`) so the heading list anchors to where the data is
  for instead of four generic group labels in a row. Sighted layout
  is unchanged.
- **Mobile settings drawer.** `HeaderControls.jsx` exposes a
  mobile-only "Settings" toggle that collapses the climate context,
  unit, and clear-startup controls behind one button on phones. The
  panel sets `display: none` while collapsed so it stays out of the AT
  tree until requested. Desktop layout unchanged.
- **Per-card retry on lazy-chunk failures.** `PanelErrorBoundary` now
  renders a "Try again" button that bumps an internal `resetKey` and
  remounts children via an identity wrapper, letting React re-evaluate
  the lazy import without taking the dashboard down.
- **`useThemeColor` hook.** Updates `<meta name="theme-color">` (with
  prior-value restore on unmount) so the iOS / Android browser chrome
  blends with the active scene gradient. Runs in a layout effect so
  the chrome bar settles before paint.
- **Layout-aware loading skeleton.** Hero meta + temp + row stripes,
  a circular gauge stub, and eight breathing precip-bar stubs that
  visually pre-figure the bento layout. Reduced-motion path holds the
  bars still.
- **Storage quota guard.** `weatherSnapshotCache` now catches
  `QuotaExceededError`, evicts the oldest snapshot, and retries once
  before yielding gracefully. Test coverage in `weatherSnapshotCache.test.mjs`.
- **Render tests for new code.** `useThemeColor.render.test.mjs`,
  `PanelErrorBoundary.render.test.mjs`,
  `HeaderControls.render.test.mjs`.

### Changed

- **Build chunking.** `vite.config.js` now splits `react` /
  `react-dom` / `scheduler` into a `react-vendor` chunk and
  `lucide-react` into its own. The app entry chunk drops from ~311 kB
  to ~128 kB, so a deploy that only touches app code re-downloads just
  that and keeps the rarely-changing vendor chunks cached.
- **localStorage write hygiene.** `useLocalStorageState` no longer
  re-writes the current value to `localStorage` on mount, so a visitor
  who never interacts doesn't get default flag values persisted; real
  state changes still write through.
- **Mobile hero density.** The four hero readings (Wind, Humidity,
  Pressure, Dew Point) used to collapse to a single column at 560px,
  producing four full-width rows that pushed the rest of the
  dashboard ~240px below the fold on phones. Keep the 2x2 grid down
  to 421px and tighten the per-stat padding so each cell fits
  comfortably; single-column still kicks in at the narrowest tier
  (≤420px) where individual cells would otherwise crush.
- **Mobile interaction polish.** Killed the default iOS gray
  tap-highlight on every interactive element via a global
  `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` rule; turned on
  `touch-action: manipulation` to eliminate the legacy 300ms
  double-tap delay on Safari; and normalised `:active` press feedback
  (`scale(var(--press-scale))`) on saved-city chips, the saved-city
  remove + undo actions, the mobile settings toggle, and sync
  buttons + toggle so every tap signals consistently.
- **Keyboard-aware city dropdown.** `100vh` on iOS Safari is the
  largest possible viewport — it does not shrink when the on-screen
  keyboard pops up — so a 320px-tall dropdown could end up entirely
  behind the keyboard on a 375x812 phone. Switch the dropdown's
  `max-height` to `dvh` and keep the `vh` declaration as a fallback
  for engines that do not yet support it.
- **Mobile touch targets.** Saved-city remove (24 → 28px), saved-city
  chips (28 → 36px), status-stack actions and retry (26-28 → 36px),
  location setup (36 → 44px), AppShell error retry (42 → 44px).
- **Safe-area support.** `<meta name="viewport">` adds
  `viewport-fit=cover`; `.app-inner` honours `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
  on every breakpoint. The previous safe-area work was a no-op on
  iOS without `viewport-fit`; this pair makes it actually work.
- **Hero icon position on mobile.** Replaced
  `flex-direction: column-reverse` with a centred horizontal row at
  <640px so the WeatherIcon stays beside (not below) the temperature.
- **Empty-state copy.** Hourly chart, 7-day forecast, and rain
  timeline now name the provider (Open-Meteo) and reassure that other
  panels remain live, instead of a generic "X is temporarily
  unavailable."
- **Accessible button copy.** Climate-context toggle reads "Show /
  Hide historical climate comparison." Cloud Sync chevron exposes
  "Expand / Collapse cloud sync controls" as its accessible name.
- **City search keyboard hints.** `inputMode="search"`,
  `autoCorrect="off"`, `autoCapitalize="words"`, `spellCheck="false"`.
- **Hero "today" rollover.** `buildHeroData` now derives the date
  label from a passed `nowMs`, bucketed to one minute. The label
  refreshes correctly across midnight on long-running tabs.
- **Critical-path preconnects.** Added `preconnect` for the two API
  origins hit on cold start (`api.open-meteo.com`,
  `geocoding-api.open-meteo.com`) and `dns-prefetch` for archive,
  air-quality, and NWS alerts.

### Fixed

- **HeroCard placeholder test.** The render-test assertion for the
  no-data body copy used a straight apostrophe while the component
  uses a typographic one, so it never matched and quietly failed the
  `code-quality` job; the regex now accepts either form.
- **HeroCard fallback honours known location.** The no-data fallback
  hardcoded "Location unavailable" / "Loading weather", which lied to
  the user during the rare window where the location was already set
  but a weather refetch was still in flight (e.g. during a transient
  retry). Use the known location name when we have one and switch
  the status line to "Loading current conditions…" accordingly.
- **`prefers-reduced-transparency`.** When the OS preference is on,
  drop `backdrop-filter`, lift card opacity to ~96%, simplify the body
  gradient, and disable the wash overlays. Layout and color story
  stay identical.
- **Focus management on global error recovery.** When transitioning
  out of `AppLoadingState` or `AppErrorState`, focus moves to
  `#main-content` so screen-reader users land back in the dashboard
  instead of `document.body`.
- **Hero location aria-label.** A single `aria-label="Location: Tokyo,
  Japan"` replaces the disjoint MapPin + text reading order.
- **Dead `.settings-toggle` CSS.** Removed CSS rules that targeted an
  element with no JSX counterpart.

### Removed

- Static `theme-color="#0b1c3f"` is now a default that
  `useThemeColor` overrides at runtime; the meta tag itself remains
  for browsers that load HTML before JS.

## [Audit pass] — 2026-05-04

### Added

- Source-scoped transient retries for Open-Meteo forecast, geocoding,
  AQI, NOAA / NWS alerts, and Open-Meteo Archive requests. Unsupported
  NWS regions still resolve immediately as unsupported coverage rather
  than retrying.
- **Data Trust Contract** enforcement at four layers (API normalization,
  per-element parsers, component fallback rendering, visual + a11y cue).
  See the README's "Data Trust Contract" section for the full layout.
- `src/utils/numbers.js` — strict `toFiniteNumber()` helper that rejects
  `null`, `undefined`, `""`, `boolean`, and `object` inputs explicitly.
  `MISSING_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER` and `isMissingPlaceholder()` constants for
  the shared em-dash glyph.
- `src/utils/temperature.js` exports `formatTemperatureValue()` and
  `formatTemperatureWithUnit()` — the unit suffix is suppressed on the
  missing path so the UI never renders the misleading `"—°F"` string.
- `useDeferredMount`, `useClimateComparison`, `usePrefersReducedData` —
  three new hooks extracted from oversized parents.
- Pure helper modules: `climateComparison.js`, `locationHelpers.js`,
  `savedLocationsSyncHelpers.js`, each with direct unit coverage.
- `PanelErrorBoundary` — isolates lazy-chunk failures so a hourly-chart
  load error cannot blank out the whole dashboard.
- `CardFallback` — shared loading-card primitive (was duplicated
  between `WeatherDashboard` and `SupplementalWeatherPanels`).
- `?mock=missing` labelled portfolio demo route (`src/mocks/missingData.js`)
  for the missing-data trust contract. The app shows an explicit demo
  notice and does not query live providers in that state. A dev-only
  fetch patch remains in `src/dev/missingDataMock.js` for lower-level
  endpoint QA.
- React render-test harness (`@testing-library/react` + `jsdom`) wired
  into `node:test` via a small esbuild-powered loader. No Vitest
  dependency.
- Per-card render tests for `Stat`, `HeroCard`, and `MetricCard` that
  pin the missing-data trust contract at the React DOM level.
- Hero "Some readings are unavailable" helper note when any stat is
  missing, with `role="status"` for assistive tech.
- Alert overflow signal — when NWS returns more than 4 alerts the card
  now surfaces an "+ N more alerts not shown" footnote.
- `prefers-reduced-data` support — historical archive fetch is
  suppressed automatically when the user-agent reports the preference.
- "CURRENT_TEMPERATURE_UNAVAILABLE" aria-label and muted typography for
  the giant hero temperature when the reading is missing.
- Last-successful forecast cache keyed by normalized coordinates, with
  schema/version guards, capped entries, and a cold-start restore path
  for offline or failed Open-Meteo forecast loads.
- A 12-hour freshness window for restored forecast snapshots so Aura
  does not present old weather as daily guidance.
- Hero daily guidance cards for rain gear, UV exposure, and wind comfort
  derived from real forecast data, with unavailable states for missing
  source inputs.
- Data Sources panel that separates forecast, AQI, NOAA/NWS alerts, and
  archive status so live, saved, unsupported, and unavailable states are
  visible without conflating them with missing readings.
- PWA manifest and production-only service worker registration. The
  service worker caches same-origin app-shell/build assets after a first
  online visit while leaving weather provider calls network-truthful.
- PWA runtime status prompts for first-install offline readiness and the
  browser install prompt, with dismissible Install/Later actions.
- Playwright offline-shell regression coverage that verifies the
  production service worker can restore `?mock=missing` after reload
  without network access.
- Deterministic missing-data demo isolation so `?mock=missing` renders
  the trust-contract route without starting live provider requests.

### Changed

- Empty city-search focus now shows saved cities as selectable combobox
  options for faster repeat switching.
- First-load location onboarding and follow-up location prompts use
  shorter copy for better mobile scanning.
- Initial loading now uses a lightweight dashboard-shaped skeleton with
  provider status copy instead of a generic spinner card.
- Decorative animated background blobs were removed; the calmer scene is
  carried by the weather gradient and static atmospheric overlays.
- Mobile rain and hourly panels now expose touch-friendly sample strips
  so dense timeline values can be inspected without hover.
- Cloud Sync now stays hidden on fresh first load until the user has at
  least one saved city, while connected/syncing/error states remain
  visible for recovery.
- Successful browser geolocation now labels raw GPS coordinates as
  "Current location" with no country label instead of inheriting the
  Chicago fallback city/country.
- `App.css` shrank from 2,067 → ~500 lines as the bento dashboard,
  AppHeader, AppShell, StatusStack, DataTrustMeta, and InfoDrawer styles
  moved next to their owning components.
- `useWeatherData` 459 → 354 lines after the climate comparison
  lifecycle moved into its own hook.
- `useSavedLocationsSync` 360 → 273 lines after pure helpers were
  extracted.
- `loadWeather` and `loadSavedCity` collapsed into a shared helper so
  the two paths cannot drift.
- `SyncAccountPanel` no longer wraps its full body in
  `aria-live="polite"`; only the error (`role="alert"`) and last-synced
  timestamp (`role="status"`) announce.
- Async controls (Use my location, Allow location, Retry, Sync now,
  Disconnect, Create sync key) now expose `aria-busy` while their
  work is in flight.
- The jsonblob sync action now says "Create sync key" instead of
  implying Aura creates a real cloud account.
- Refresh/offline banners now name the failed forecast source and, when
  a cached forecast is restored, include the saved snapshot timestamp.
- AQI/UV missing states now name the source that failed or omitted the
  reading instead of using generic unavailable copy.
- Supplemental AQI, archive, and alert requests now retry transient
  failures once while preserving abort behavior and unsupported-region
  alert fallbacks.
- GitHub Actions quality gates now include lint, Node tests, render
  tests, production build, serial Playwright, visual checks, Lighthouse
  budgets, concurrency cancellation, and failure artifacts.
- Lighthouse budget checks now target the deterministic `?mock=missing`
  app shell and use a per-run Chrome profile to avoid stale service
  workers or Windows profile-lock failures.
- The 1-minute `DataTrustMeta` clock pauses while the tab is hidden so
  background tabs do not churn re-renders.
- InfoDrawer trigger uses a `HelpCircle` icon instead of a literal `?`.
- Hero card hides the unit suffix when a reading is missing — `"—°F"`
  is gone everywhere.

### Fixed

- Literal `°` rendering on the hourly chart Y axis and `—`
  rendering in the AQI/UV empty state — JSX text was treating the
  escape sequences as literal characters.
- Hourly chart "Now" indicator skipping ahead instead of snapping to
  the active hour band.
- `parseCoordinates(null, null)` resolving to `(0, 0)` Null Island.
- `dataTrust.toTimestamp(null)` computing "minutes since the Unix epoch"
  and rendering a misleading "Stale data" warning.
- `convertTemp(null)` silently producing `0°F`.
- `Number(null) === 0` coercion throughout — every nullable API field
  was being silently rendered as `0%` / `0 hPa` / `0°F`. Closed at the
  API boundary (`transforms.js`, `openMeteo.js`) and at every consumer
  (HourlyCard, ForecastCard, NowcastCard, RainCard, ExposureSection,
  HeroCard, NowcastCard, MetricCard, WeatherIcon, DataTrustMeta).
- Precipitation and wind formatters silently rendering `"0.00 in"`,
  `"0 mph"`, `"N"`, `"Calm"` for null API reads — `formatPrecipitation`,
  `formatWindSpeed`, `windDirectionName`, and `classifyWind` now route
  through `toFiniteNumber` and surface `"—"` / `"Variable"` / `"Unknown"`
  instead.
- Domain classifiers leaking the same coercion bug — `classifyStormRisk`
  (CAPE input), `calculatePressureTrend` (null pressure slots were being
  counted as 0 hPa data points), and `getWeather` / `WeatherIcon` (null
  code → "Clear" / Sun icon by accident) now route through
  `toFiniteNumber` so the null path is explicit.
- Lazy chunk failures crashing the whole app via the root error
  boundary — now isolated by `PanelErrorBoundary`.
- `buildClimateComparison` producing fake "65°F warmer than average"
  lines when archive responses had nullish samples.
- City switch leaking the previous city's weather under the new city's
  name — weather state now clears on a different-coordinates request,
  while same-city refreshes still keep the snapshot visible behind the
  `Refreshing` pill.
- Date-dependent test in `fetchHistoricalTemperatureAverage` that
  silently failed on a calendar-day boundary.

### Removed

- Dead `.settings-toggle` CSS rules — no JSX referenced the class for
  several refactors.
- Duplicated `CardFallback` (was inline in two layout files).
- Duplicate inline numeric coercion helpers in HourlyCard, ForecastCard,
  NowcastCard, useRainAnalysis (all now route through the shared
  `toFiniteNumber`).
- `src/utils/missingData.js` — duplicate of `numbers.js` with looser
  coercion semantics. `hasFiniteValue` moved into `numbers.js`,
  `MISSING_VALUE_DASH` consumers redirected to the existing
  `MISSING_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER`, dead `formatMissingValue` export removed.
  Single source of truth for the trust contract.

### Tests

- 45 → **244** Node tests across 55 suites, including React render tests
  via `@testing-library/react` + `jsdom`. New regressions pin null-input
  contracts, source-scoped retries, cache restore behavior, honest
  browser-location labels, service worker registration gates, and PWA
  install prompt handling.
- 12 → **15** Playwright smoke/flow checks, including cached offline
  restore, offline app-shell reload, honest GPS labels, missing-data
  placeholders, missing-demo provider isolation, axe-core, and the
  unicode-escape leak guard.
