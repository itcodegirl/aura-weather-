 * shared / bookmarked URLs land with a meaningful page title instead
 * of the static marketing string. We intentionally do NOT include the
 * temperature in the title — it changes minute-to-minute and would
 * thrash both the tab text and any history/bookmark snapshots.
 *
 * The hook is a no-op (and preserves the static index.html title)
 * until we have a real location name. That keeps cold-start renders
 * looking branded rather than half-resolved.
